    <h3>Halo Amel Cantik</h3>
    <p><div>My name is MR816, weird? yes, yes I choose to be weird rather than have to bear the embarrassment of saying it to you directly. Long time no see, the last time I saw you was at graduation, to be honest you looked elegant at that time.</div>
    <br>
   <div>How are you? I hope you are alright. But why am I embarrassed to say something to you, even though we have communicated? Yeah, I have a crush on you. Want to know why I have a crush on you and who I really am? </div><br>
<div>It all starts at the beginning of 2023, where we are required to be in the same room. I was fascinated when I first saw you, with your curly eyelashes and glasses that made you even cuter, to be honest I was fascinated. At that time I thought I had a crush on you.</div>
<br>
<div>Day after day all I can think about is your beautiful gaze at that time, but falling in love with the opposite sex for teenagers is a common thing. According to research, feelings of liking someone generally fade within 3 months. 3 months passed, but what happened? My love for you is still there today, July 16 2024.</div>
<br>
 <div>I don't know why my love for you never stops, I want to hold hands and joke with you like a teenager in general, but that's against religion, yes I have love but Allah has rules. I still have to improve myself first before carrying you, of course I also need to make my family happy. Hopefully in the future we can still meet, meet you in my prime, when I am successful, and even be your life partner. wait for me in the future, I will meet you. Remember my name.</div>
